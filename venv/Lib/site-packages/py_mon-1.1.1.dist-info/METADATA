Simple package to automatically restart application when file changes are detected!

I spend a lot of time developing discord bots and it's a hassle to constantly ``Ctrl+C`` and then run the bot again on my terminal.

As an active web developer who works with NodeJS, I decided to make something like [nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon) but for Python. Introducing ``py-mon``, a simple and easy to use python package that automatically runs your python script when it detects file changes. I've only spent a couple of hours in developing this and I hope to add a bunch of features in the future, from ignoring certain files to prioritizing certain extensions.

## Quickstart
I wanted to make this package as easy as possible to use. Here's a quick start, it's essentially all you'll need.

### Installation
```
pip install -U py-mon
```
### Execution
```
pymon filename.py
```

That's pretty much it! Thanks for everything, I would appreciate it if you could leave a follow or star this repository! <3
